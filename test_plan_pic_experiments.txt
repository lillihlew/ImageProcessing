Test Plan for pic experiments:
This program should take and display a photo, then spin left and take and
display a new photo, then turn that second photo to gray and display it,
then turn left and take a third new photo, then check what each pixel in
the third photo's max value is, R, G, or B, then set that pixel to its max
R G or B value and set the other two to 0, and display that new image. We
will watch the program execute and judge it's success based on the below
criteria: 

Connect to robot:check, shows a connection message in the terminal
take and display first photo: check, saw it on the screen

Spin left: check, watched it turn

Take and display second photo:check, saw it on the screen

Convert second photo to graysale and display:check, saw the photo in gray
on the screen

Spin left:check, watched it turn

Take and display third photo:check, saw the photo on the screen

Set third photo to max rgb values then display it:check, saw it on the
screen
(this one is obvious since we wrote it to show the max R, G, and B values,
so the photo only contains red green and blue).

Disconnect:check, says "stopped and Bluetooth connection closed" on terminal




Test Plan for flip-picture:
This program should take and display an image, then flip it upside down and
show the new image. If the image is upside down, then it was successfully
flipped. We will watch the program execute and judge it's success based on
the below criteria: 

Connect: check, displayed connection information on terminal

Take and display image: check, watched image appear on screen

Flip image and display new image:check, watched flipped image appear on screen

Disocnnect: check, disconnect information appeared on terminal




Test Plan create negative
This program should take and display an image, then invert the image to its
negative self, and display the new image. We will watch the
program execute and judge it's success based on the below criteria:

Connect:check, displayed connection information on terminal

Take and display image:check, watched image appear on screen

Create negative image and display new image:check, watched negative image
appear on screen

Disconnect:check, disconnect information appeared on terminal



Test Plan find brightest
This program should take and display an image, then print a line about
where the brightest pixel in the image is located. We will watch the
program execute and judge it's success based on the below criteria:

Connect:check, displayed connection information on terminal

Take and display image:check, watched image appear on screen

Print line about where brightest pixel is in the image: check, line printed
to terminal during our test: "The location of the brightest pixel is row 0,
column 114." which aligns with what we guessed based on the displayed image.

Disconnect:check, disconnect information appeared on terminal




Our programs all work correctly; we see no lingering issues.
